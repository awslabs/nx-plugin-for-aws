Actually try each one (but do not deploy any AWS resources). Report what works, what's broken, and what's confusing. \nKeep a detailed action log: record the exact commands you ran, the actual output or errors, and the file paths involved. Do not summarize — record what happened. \nWrite like a staff engineer's internal notes. No emojis. No filler. State facts directly. Do not hedge with \"might\", \"could potentially\", \"it seems like\".",
