### Runtime config

In order to integrate with cognito or trpc backends, you need to have a `runtime-config.json` file in your `/public` website directory. You can fetch this is follows:

`AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-2 CDK_APP_DIR=./dist/packages/infra/cdk.out nx run <%= fullyQualifiedName %>:load:runtime-config`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure you have deployed your infrastructure first before executing this command.
