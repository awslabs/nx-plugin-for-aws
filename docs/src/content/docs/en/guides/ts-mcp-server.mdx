# TypeScript MCP Server Generator

Generate a TypeScript [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for providing context to Large Language Models (LLMs).

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard that allows AI assistants to interact with external tools and resources. It provides a consistent way for LLMs to:

- Execute tools (functions) that perform actions or retrieve information
- Access resources that provide context or data

## Usage

### Generate an MCP Server

You can generate a TypeScript MCP server in two ways:

<RunGenerator generator="ts#mcp-server" />

### Options

<GeneratorParameters generator="ts#mcp-server" />

## Generator Output

The generator will create the following project files:

<FileTree>
  - packages/\<name>/
    - README.md Documentation for the MCP server with usage instructions
    - project.json Nx project configuration with build, bundle, and dev targets
    - src/
      - index.ts Entry point for the MCP server
      - server.ts Main server definition, defining tools and resources
      - global.d.ts TypeScript type declarations for importing markdown files
      - resources/
        - example-context.md Example markdown file used as a resource for the MCP server
</FileTree>

:::note
Please refer to the <Link path="/guides/typescript-project">TypeScript project generator documentation</Link> for further details regarding the generator output.

## Working with Your MCP Server

### Adding Tools

Tools are functions that the AI assistant can call to perform actions. You can add new tools in the `server.ts` file:

```typescript
server.tool("toolName", "tool description",
  { param1: z.string(), param2: z.number() }, // Input schema using Zod
  async ({ param1, param2 }) => {
    // Tool implementation
    return {
      content: [{ type: "text", text: "Result" }]
    };
  }
);
```

### Adding Resources

Resources provide context to the AI assistant. You can add static resources from files or dynamic resources:

```typescript
// Static resource from a file
import exampleContext from './resources/example-context.md';

server.resource('resource-name', 'example://resource', async (uri) => ({
  contents: [{ uri: uri.href, text: exampleContext }],
}));

// Dynamic resource
server.resource('dynamic-resource', 'dynamic://resource', async (uri) => {
  const data = await fetchSomeData();
  return {
    contents: [{ uri: uri.href, text: data }],
  };
});
```

## Configuring with AI Assistants

To use your MCP server with AI assistants, you need to bundle it first:

<NxCommands commands={['run your-mcp-server:bundle']} />

This creates a bundled version in `dist/packages/your-mcp-server/bundle/index.js` (path may vary based on your directory settings).

### Configuration Files

Most AI assistants that support MCP use a similar configuration approach. You'll need to create or update a configuration file with your MCP server details:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-mcp-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/workspace/dist/packages/your-mcp-server/bundle/index.js"
      ],
      "transportType": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/workspace/dist/packages/your-mcp-server/bundle/index.js` with the actual path to your bundled MCP server.

:::caution
If you receive an error such as `ENOENT node` when connecting to your server, you might need to specify the full path to `node`, which you can obtain by running `which node` in your terminal.
:::

### Assistant-Specific Configuration

Please refer to the following documentation for configuring MCP with specific AI Assistants:

<Snippet name="mcp/assistant-docs" />

:::tip
Some AI Assistants, such as Amazon Q Developer, allow you to specify workspace level MCP server configuration, which is particularly useful for defining the relevant MCP servers for a particular project.
:::

## Development Workflow

### Build Targets

The generator is built on top of the <Link path="/guides/typescript-project">TypeScript project generator</Link> and as such inherits its targets, as well as adding the following additional targets:

#### Bundle

The `bundle` task uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to create a single bundled JavaScript file that can be used with AI assistants:

<NxCommands commands={['run your-mcp-server:bundle']} />

This creates a bundled version in `dist/packages/your-mcp-server/bundle/index.js` (path may vary based on your directory settings).

#### Dev

The `dev` task watches for changes in your project and automatically rebuilds the bundle:

<NxCommands commands={['run your-mcp-server:dev']} />

This is particularly useful during development as it ensures your AI Assistant utilises the latest version of your MCP server.

:::note
Some AI assistants will require you to restart the MCP server for changes to take effect.
