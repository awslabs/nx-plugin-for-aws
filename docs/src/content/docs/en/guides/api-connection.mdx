import { LinkCard, CardGrid, LinkButton } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This generator is used to connect projects to APIs. Simply select the source project (the project that will call your API) and target project (your API project), and this generator will handle integrating the two.

### Supported Connections

The API Connection generator supports the following connections:

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="React to tRPC"
    description="Call a tRPC API from a React website"
    href="api-connection/react-trpc"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="React to FastAPI"
    description="Call a Python FastAPI from a React website"
    href="api-connection/react-fastapi"
  />
