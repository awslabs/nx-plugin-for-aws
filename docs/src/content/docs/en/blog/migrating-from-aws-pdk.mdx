This guide walks you through an example migration of an [AWS PDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-pdk) project to the Nx Plugin for AWS, as well as providing general guidance on this topic.

Migrating to the Nx Plugin for AWS provides the following benefits over PDK:

- Faster builds
- Easier to use (UI and CLI)
- Vibe-coding friendly (<Link path="/get_started/building-with-ai">try our MCP server!</Link>)
- More modern technologies
- Local API and website development
- More control (modify vended files to fit your use-case)
- And more!

:::caution
There are many nuances and considerations when migrating a project. This guide is for a simple example, and there may be steps missing here that are required for your project.

This guide opts for an approach where we create a fresh workspace and copy pieces from our PDK project into a new project. If you need to migrate differently, or have any questions on moving from PDK to the Nx Plugin for AWS, [reach out on GitHub discussions](https://github.com/awslabs/nx-plugin-for-aws/discussions)!

Note also that some features of PDK don't have exact equivalents. Refer to the [FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions) section for some hints/ideas for these.

:::caution
This is written as a point-of-time guide and will most likely not be updated as the Nx Plugin for AWS evolves. To compensate for this, the guide pins the version of `@aws/nx-plugin` to `0.50.0`. You can try with the latest version if following along, but there may be some deviations from the guide.

## Example Migration: Shopping List Application

In this guide, we will use the [Shopping List Application from the PDK Tutorial](https://aws.github.io/aws-pdk/getting_started/shopping_list_app.html) as our target project to migrate. Follow the steps in that tutorial to create the target project if you wish to follow along yourself.

The shopping list application consists of the following PDK project types:

- `MonorepoTsProject`
- `TypeSafeApiProject`
- `CloudscapeReactTsWebsiteProject`
- `InfrastructureTsProject`

### Create Workspace

To start, we'll create a new workspace for our new project. While more extreme than an in-place migration, this approach gives us the cleanest end result. Creating an Nx workspace is equivalent to using PDK's `MonorepoTsProject`:

<CreateNxWorkspaceCommand workspace="shopping-list" iacProvider="CDK" nxVersion="21.4.1" nxPluginVersion="0.50.0" />

Open up the `shopping-list` directory this command creates in your favourite IDE.

## Frequently Asked Questions

This section provides guidance for features of PDK that aren't covered by the example migration above.

As a general rule when moving from PDK, we recommend starting any project with an Nx Workspace, given its similarities to the PDK Monorepo. We also recommend using our generators as the primitives on which to build any new types.

<CreateNxWorkspaceCommand workspace="my-project" />
