This page provides some troubleshooting guidance for issues you may encounter when using Nx.

## Nx Daemon

The [Nx Daemon](https://nx.dev/docs/concepts/nx-daemon) is a process which continuously watches for workspace changes in order to recompute its project graph. This provides a performance boost, particularly for large projects, but can sometimes be the cause of issues depending on your environment.

This can manifest itself in different ways, one of which is the following error:

```bash
 NX   Could not find project "@scope/project"

Pass --verbose to see the stacktrace.
```

For this, and any other unexpected error, it's always worth resetting Nx and retrying in case of a daemon issue. You can use the following command:

<NxCommands commands={['reset']} />

Failing this, you can try [disabling the daemon altogether](https://nx.dev/docs/concepts/nx-daemon#turning-it-off).

:::warning
The `nx watch` command requires the daemon, and therefore some of your hot-reloading targets may not function if you disable it.
