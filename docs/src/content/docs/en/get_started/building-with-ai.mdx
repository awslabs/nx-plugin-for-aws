The Nx Plugin for AWS includes an [MCP Server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) which enables AI assistants to work with the Nx Plugin for AWS. By utilizing the MCP Server, you can accelerate your development workflow with AI, while benefitting from your projects being scaffolded in a deterministic fashion, spending less time and less of your context window on setting up the main components.

Use the MCP Server with your AI Assistant of choice, such as Amazon Q Developer, Cline, Claude Code or Cursor.

## MCP Server Configuration

Most AI Assistants will have a JSON file for MCP server configuration. In Amazon Q Developer, this is located in `~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json`. Add an entry for the Nx Plugin for AWS MCP Server

<Snippet name="mcp/config" />

Please refer to the following documentation for configuring MCP with specific AI Assistants:

<Snippet name="mcp/assistant-docs" />

## Start Vibe Coding

Ask your AI Assistant to build something using the `aws-nx-mcp` MCP Server! Generally AI Assistants will start by creating a workspace, scaffolding with the applicable generators, and then filling in the business logic.

## Build your own MCP Server
