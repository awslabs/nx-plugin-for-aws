## Module 4: UI implementation

To start building the UI, we want to configure our local dev server to point to our deployed sandbox. To do this, run the following command:

<NxCommands commands={["run @dungeon-adventure/game-ui:load:runtime-config"]} />

This command will pull down the `runtime-config.json` that is deployed and store it locally within the `packages/game-ui/public` folder.

Now we can start the dev server with the following command:

<NxCommands commands={["run @dungeon-adventure/game-ui:serve"]} />

You can then open up your local website in a browser at which time you will be prompted to log in and follow the prompts to create a new user. Once completed you should see the baseline website:

<Image src={baselineWebsitePng} alt="baseline-website.png" width="800" height="600" />

<Aside type="caution">
_We will keep the dev server running throughout the remainder of this module as it will automatically hot-reload any changes we make._
</Aside>

### Create a new '/game' route

Let's showcase the capabilities of `@tanstack/react-router` by creating a new type-safe route. To do this, simply create an empty file at the following location: `packages/game-ui/src/routes/game/index.tsx`. Pay close attention to the dev server logs:

```bash
‚ôªÔ∏è  Regenerating routes...
üü° Updating /Users/dimecha/dungeon-adventure/packages/game-ui/src/routes/game/index.tsx
üü° Updating /Users/dimecha/dungeon-adventure/packages/game-ui/src/routeTree.gen.ts
‚úÖ Processed routes in 27ms
```

The `@tanstack/react-router` automatically has configured your new route and you will notice that the file you just created is already populated with the route path:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/game/')({
  component: RouteComponent,
})

function RouteComponent() {
  return <div>Hello "/game/"!</div>
}
```

Now if you navigate to `http://localhost:4200/game` you will see your new page has been rendered!

<Image src={baselineGamePng} alt="baseline-game.png" width="800" height="600" />

Let's also update the `index.tsx` file to load our new `/game` route by default. Notice how when you update the `to` field, you have a list of type-safe routes to choose from.

<E2EDiff before="dungeon-adventure/4/routes/index.tsx.old.template" after="dungeon-adventure/4/routes/index.tsx.template" lang="tsx" />

Finally we can delete the `packages/game-ui/src/routes/welcome/` folder as this is no longer required.

### Layout updates

The default layout that is configured is more akin to a SaaS style business application than a game. We are going to re-configure the layout and re-theme it to be more akin to a dungeon style game.

Let's make the following changes to `packages/game-ui/src`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="config.ts">
<E2EDiff before="dungeon-adventure/4/config.ts.old.template" after="dungeon-adventure/4/config.ts.template" lang="typescript" />
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="components/AppLayout/index.tsx">
<E2ECode path="dungeon-adventure/4/AppLayout/index.tsx.template" lang="tsx" />
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="styles.css">
<E2ECode path="dungeon-adventure/4/styles.css.template" lang="css" />
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now let's delete the `packages/game-ui/src/components/AppLayout/navitems.ts` and `packages/game-ui/src/hooks/useAppLayout.tsx` files as they are unused.

### Game pages

Let's create the Game pages which will call our APIs and finish our game implementation:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="index.tsx">
<E2ECode path="dungeon-adventure/4/routes/game/index.tsx.template" lang="tsx" />
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="$playerName.tsx">

<E2ECode path="dungeon-adventure/4/routes/game/$playerName.tsx.template" lang="tsx" />

<Aside type="tip">
The `$playerName` syntax will instruct `@tanstack/react-router` to treat `playerName` as a [path param](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/guide/path-params). Additionally, we implement the `validateSearch` method which ensures that the `genre` query parameter is strongly typed to our genre enum.
</Aside>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once you make these changes, your local dev server (http://localhost:4200/) should now have your game ready to play!

<Drawer title="Build and Deploy" trigger="You can also build & deploy your code to Cloudfront if you prefer.">

To build your code, run the following command:

<NxCommands commands={['run-many --target build --all']} />

Now deploy your application:

<NxCommands commands={['run @dungeon-adventure/infra:deploy dungeon-adventure-infra-sandbox']} />

Once deployed, navigate to your Cloudfront url which can be found by inspecting the cdk deploy outputs.

</Drawer>

<Image src={gameSelectPng} alt="game-select.png" width="500" height="400" />
<div style="margin-top: -100px; margin-left: 100px;">
<Image src={gameConversationPng} alt="game-conversation.png" width="500" height="400" />
</div>

Congratulations. You have built and deployed your Dungeon Adventure Game!  üéâüéâüéâ
