## Wrap up

Congratulations! You’ve created an Agentic AI Dungeon adventure game that uses many of the available generators found within the `@aws/nx-plugin`.  🎉🎉🎉

## What next?

We recommend you try your hand at extending the codebase with the following capabilities on your own:

1. Add the <Link path="guides/license">license generator</Link> to your project which will automatically manage LICENSE files and source code headers in your workspace.
2. <Link path="get_started/tutorials/contribute-generator">Contribute your own generator</Link> to simplify the addition on new tRPC APIs.
3. Add a new `resetToAction` api (using your above generator) in GameAPI which allows you to go back in time and delete all actions from a given point. Update the UI to add a button on a conversation bubble to reset to this point (and call the newly created API).
4. Explore the various component guides using the left navigation.

## Destroying resources

1. To destroy the AWS resources that were created, run the following command:

<NxCommands commands={['run @dungeon-adventure/infra:destroy "dungeon-adventure-infra-sandbox/*"']} />

    This will prompt you for a list of stacks to delete which should comprise of the `dungeon-adventure-infra-sandbox/Application/GameUI/waf` and `dungeon-adventure-infra-sandbox/Application`.

2. Enter `Y` to continue. CloudFormation will destroy your stacks.
