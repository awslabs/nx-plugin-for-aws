## Wrap up

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve created a dungeon adventure game that utilizes many of the available generators found within the `@aws/nx-plugin`.  ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## What's next?

We recommend you try your hand at extending the codebase with the following capabilities on your own:

1. Add the <Link path="guides/license">license generator</Link> to your project which will automatically manage LICENSE files and source code headers in your workspace.
2. <Link path="get_started/tutorials/contribute-generator">Contribute your own generator</Link> to simplify the addition on new tRPC apis.
3. Add a new `resetToAction` api (using your above generator) in GameAPI which allows you to go back in time and delete all actions from a given point. Then update the UI to add a button on a conversation bubble to reset to this point (and call the newly created API).
4. Explore the various guides available

### Destroying resources

To destroy the AWS resources that were created, run the following command:

<NxCommands commands={['run @dungeon-adventure/infra:destroy --all']} />

This will prompt you for a list of stacks to delete which should comprise of the `waf` and `dungeon-adventure-infra-sandbox`. Enter `Y` and then Cloudformation will destroy your stacks.
