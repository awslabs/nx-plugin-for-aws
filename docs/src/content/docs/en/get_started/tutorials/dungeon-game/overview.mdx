## Overview

You will build an Agentic AI-powered dungeon adventure game during this tutorial. This tutorial does not assume any existing knowledge of the `@aws/nx-plugin` or related technologies. The techniques you'll learn in this tutorial are fundamental to building any `@aws/nx-plugin` based application, and fully understanding it will give you a deep understanding of the `@aws/nx-plugin` and a basic understanding of how to use [NX](https://nx.dev/).

<Aside>This tutorial is designed for people who prefer to learn by doing and want to quickly try making something tangible. If you prefer learning each concept step by step, refer to the individual component guides</Aside>

Users who complete this tutorial can expect to walk away with the knowledge to:

- use the `@aws/nx-plugin` to create new applications
- use NX to manage/build their codebase
- build APIs using tRPC
- build Agents using Strands
- build MCP servers in TypeScript
- use Tanstack router to create new pages
- use Tanstack query to call backend APIs
- create and deploy CDK infrastructure

## What are you building?

In this tutorial, you'll build an Agentic AI-powered dungeon adventure game with `@aws/nx-plugin`.

You can see what it will look like when you're finished here:

<Image src={gameSelectPng} alt="game-select.png" width="500" height="400" />
<div style="margin-top: -100px; margin-left: 100px;">
<Image src={gameConversationPng} alt="game-conversation.png" width="500" height="400" />
</div>

### Components of the application

The Agentic AI-powered dungeon adventure game will be built using the following component architecture:

<Image style="margin: auto" src={dungeonAdventureArchitecturePng} alt="dungeon-game-architecture.png" height="600" />

- React/Vite frontend website utilising:
  - Amazon Cognito/Identity Pools for secure API calls
  - [Tanstack router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) which supports type-safe file based routing
  - Generated SDKs for calling the Game API
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) API which uses [ElectroDB](https://electrodb.dev/)/[DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) for managing the game state
- [Strands](https://strandsagents.com/latest/) Agent hosted on [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) for running the game
- TypeScript MCP Server hosted on [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) for the agent to manage the player's inventory
- [CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) infrastructure to deploy the application

## Prerequisites

The following global dependencies are needed before proceeding:

<Snippet name="required-prerequisites" />
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is required for building the AgentCore components

If you use an AI Assistant such as Kiro, Amazon Q Developer, Cursor, Claude Code or Cline, you may also wish to <Link path="/get_started/building-with-ai">install the Nx Plugin for AWS MCP server.</Link>
