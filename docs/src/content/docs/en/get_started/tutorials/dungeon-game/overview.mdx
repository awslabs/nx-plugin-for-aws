Using this tutorial, you will build an Agentic AI-powered dungeon adventure game with `@aws/nx-plugin`. This tutorial does not assume any existing knowledge of the `@aws/nx-plugin` or related technologies. 
The techniques you'll learn in this tutorial will help:
- Build any `@aws/nx-plugin` based application,
- Provide a deep understanding of the `@aws/nx-plugin`, and 
- Get a basic understanding of how to use the [NX](https://nx.dev/) framework.

<Aside>This tutorial is designed for people who prefer to learn by doing and want to quickly try making something tangible. If you prefer learning each concept step by step, refer to the individual component guides using the left navigation.</Aside>

At the end of the tutorial, you will walk away with the knowledge to:

- use the `@aws/nx-plugin` to create new applications,
- use NX to manage/build their codebase,
- build APIs using tRPC,
- build Agents using Strands,
- build MCP servers in TypeScript,
- use Tanstack router to create new pages,
- use Tanstack query to call backend APIs, and
- create and deploy CDK infrastructure.

## What are you building?

In this tutorial, you'll build an Agentic AI-powered dungeon adventure game with `@aws/nx-plugin`.

The game interface will resemble something like this diagram:

<Image src={gameSelectPng} alt="game-select.png" width="500" height="400" />
<div style="margin-top: -100px; margin-left: 100px;">
<Image src={gameConversationPng} alt="game-conversation.png" width="500" height="400" />
</div>

### Application architecture

The Agentic AI-powered dungeon adventure game is built using the following architecture:

<Image style="margin: auto" src={dungeonAdventureArchitecturePng} alt="dungeon-game-architecture.png" height="600" />

- React/Vite frontend website utilising:
  - Amazon Cognito/Identity Pools for secure API calls.
  - [Tanstack router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) which supports type-safe file based routing.
  - Generated SDKs for calling the Game API.
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) API which uses [ElectroDB](https://electrodb.dev/)/[DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) for managing the game state.
- [Strands](https://strandsagents.com/latest/) Agent hosted on [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) for running the game.
- TypeScript MCP Server hosted on [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) for the agent to manage the player's inventory.
- [CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) infrastructure to deploy the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, you will need the following global dependencies:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is required for building the AgentCore components
