## Overview

You will build an AI powered dungeon adventure game during this tutorial. This tutorial does not assume any existing knowledge of the `@aws/nx-plugin` or related technologies. The techniques you'll learn in this tutorial are fundamental to building any `@aws/nx-plugin` based application, and fully understanding it will give you a deep understanding of the `@aws/nx-plugin` and a basic understanding of how to use [NX](https://nx.dev/).

<Aside>This tutorial is designed for people who prefer to learn by doing and want to quickly try making something tangible. If you prefer learning each concept step by step, refer to the individual component Guides from the left navigation.</Aside>

Users who complete this tutorial will learn how to:

- use the `@aws/nx-plugin` to create new applications,
- use NX to manage/build their codebase,
- build APIs using both tRPC and FastAPI,
- use a TanStack router to create new pages,
- use a TanStack query to call backend APIs,
- make modifications to generated code to be fit for purpose, and
- create and deploy CDK infrastructure.

## What are you building?

In this tutorial, you will build an AI powered dungeon adventure game with `@aws/nx-plugin`.

This is what the final output will look like, after completion of the tutorial.

</div>

### Application components

We will build the AI powered dungeon adventure game using the following component architecture.

<Image class="white-bg" src={dungeonAdventureArchitecturePng} alt="dungeon-game-architecture.png" width="800" height="600" />

1. The [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) API uses [ElectroDB](https://electrodb.dev/)/[DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) for managing the game state.
2. The Python/[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) Lambda function with streaming responses for story generation (powered by [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/))
3. A React/Vite frontend website using:
  - Amazon Cognito/Identity Pools for secure API calls.
  - [TanStack router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) which supports type-safe file based routing.
  - Generated SDKs for calling the Game and Story APIs (leveraging [TanStack query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest))

A [CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) infrastructure to deploy the application components.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, install these global dependencies:

<Snippet name="prerequisites" />
- Ensure that you have enable access (in your AWS account) to the Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 model within Bedrock for your target region. For instructions on how to complet this, use the steps outlined in the [Add or remove access to Amazon Bedrock foundation models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html) section.
