### Recommended

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is required for some generators.
- [Terraform >= 1.12](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) is required if you choose to use this for infrastructure as code instead of CDK
  - verify by running `terraform --version`
- If you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), we recommend installing the [Nx Console VSCode Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nrwl.angular-console).
