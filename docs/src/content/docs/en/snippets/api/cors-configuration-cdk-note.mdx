title: CORS configuration CDK

import Link from '@components/link.astro';

:::note
If your solution includes a website you can configure its CloudFront distribution as the only permitted CORS origin in the API gateway / API AWS Lambda integrations for HTTP / REST APIs. Note that this restriction is not applied to preflight OPTIONS for REST APIs - please +1 [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/awslabs/nx-plugin-for-aws/issues/377) to help prioritise addressing this.
You will need to create the API and then call the API `restrictCorsTo` method with the created website.

```ts
import { MyApi, MyWebsite } from ':my-scope/common-constructs';

export class ExampleStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
    const api = new MyApi(this, 'MyApi', {
      integrations: MyApi.defaultIntegrations(this).build(),
    });
    const website = new MyWebsite(this, 'MyWebsite');
    api.restrictCorsTo(website);
  }
}
```

The `MyWebsite` construct can be generated using the <Link path="/guides/react-website">`ts#react-website` generator</Link>
