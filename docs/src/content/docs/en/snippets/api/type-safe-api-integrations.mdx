title: Type-Safe API Integrations
---

The REST/HTTP API CDK constructs are configured to provide a type-safe interface for defining integrations for each of your operations.

#### Default Integrations

You can use the static `defaultIntegrations` to make use of the default pattern, which defines an individual AWS Lambda function for each operation:

```ts {2}
new MyApi(this, 'MyApi', {
  integrations: MyApi.defaultIntegrations(this).build(),
});
```

#### Accessing Integrations

You can access the underlying AWS Lambda functions via the API construct's `integrations` property, in a type-safe manner. For example, if your API defines an operation named `sayHello` and you need to add some permissions to this function, you can do so as follows:

```ts {6}
const api = new MyApi(this, 'MyApi', {
  integrations: MyApi.defaultIntegrations(this).build(),
});

// sayHello is typed to the operations defined in your API
api.integrations.sayHello.handler.addToRolePolicy(new PolicyStatement({
  effect: Effect.ALLOW,
  actions: [...],
  resources: [...],
}));
```

#### Customising Default Options

If you would like to customise the options used when creating the Lambda function for each default integration, you can use the `withDefaultOptions` method. For example, if you would like all of your Lambda functions to reside in a Vpc:

```ts {5-7}
const vpc = new Vpc(this, 'Vpc', ...);

new MyApi(this, 'MyApi', {
  integrations: MyApi.defaultIntegrations(this)
    .withDefaultOptions({
      vpc,
    })
    .build(),
});
```

#### Overriding Integrations

You can also override integrations for specific operations using the `withOverrides` method. Each override must specify an `integration` property which is typed to the appropriate CDK integration construct for the HTTP or REST API. The `withOverrides` method is also type-safe. For example, if you would like to override a `getDocumentation` API to point to documentation hosted by some external website you could achieve this as follows:

```ts
new MyApi(this, 'MyApi', {
  integrations: MyApi.defaultIntegrations(this)
    .withOverrides({
      getDocumentation: {
        integration: new HttpIntegration('https://example.com/documentation'),
      },
    })
    .build(),
});
```

You will also notice that the overridden integration no longer has a `handler` property when accessing it via `api.integrations.getDocumentation`.

You can add additional properties to an integration which will also be typed accordingly, allowing for other types of integration to be abstracted but remain type-safe, for example if you have created an S3 integration for a REST API and later wish to reference the bucket for a particular operation, you can do so as follows:

```ts {13, 41}
const storageBucket = new Bucket(this, 'Bucket', { ... });

const apiGatewayRole = new Role(this, 'ApiGatewayS3Role', {
  assumedBy: new ServicePrincipal('apigateway.amazonaws.com'),
});

storageBucket.grantRead(apiGatewayRole);

const api = new MyApi(this, 'MyApi', {
  integrations: MyApi.defaultIntegrations(this)
    .withOverrides({
      getFile: {
        bucket: storageBucket,
        integration: new AwsIntegration({
          service: 's3',
          integrationHttpMethod: 'GET',
          path: `${storageBucket.bucketName}/{fileName}`,
          options: {
            credentialsRole: apiGatewayRole,
            requestParameters: {
              'integration.request.path.fileName': 'method.request.querystring.fileName',
            },
            integrationResponses: [{ statusCode: '200' }],
          },
        }),
        options: {
          requestParameters: {
            'method.request.querystring.fileName': true,
          },
          methodResponses: [{
            statusCode: '200',
          }],
        }
      },
    })
    .build(),
});

// Later, perhaps in another file, you can access the bucket property we defined
// in a type-safe manner
api.integrations.getFile.bucket.grantRead(...);
```

#### Overriding Authorizers

You can also supply `options` in your integration to override particular method options such as authorizers, for example if you wished to use Cognito authentication for your `getDocumentation` operation:

```ts
new MyApi(this, 'MyApi', {
  integrations: MyApi.defaultIntegrations(this)
    .withOverrides({
      getDocumentation: {
        integration: new HttpIntegration('https://example.com/documentation'),
        options: {
          authorizer: new CognitoUserPoolsAuthorizer(...) // for REST, or HttpUserPoolAuthorizer for an HTTP API
        }
      },
    })
    .build(),
});
```

#### Explicit Integrations

If you prefer, you can choose not to use the default integrations and instead directly supply one for each operation. This is useful if, for example, each operation needs to use a different type of integration or you would like to receive a type error when adding new operations:

```ts
new MyApi(this, 'MyApi', {
  integrations: {
    sayHello: {
      integration: new LambdaIntegration(...),
    },
    getDocumentation: {
      integration: new HttpIntegration(...),
    },
  },
});
```

#### Router Pattern

If you prefer to deploy a single Lambda function to service all API requests, you can freely edit the `defaultIntegrations` method for your API to create a single function instead of one per integration:

```ts {5,11-12}
// packages/common/constructs/src/app/apis/my-api.ts
export class MyApi<...> extends ... {

  public static defaultIntegrations = (scope: Construct) => {
    const router = new Function(scope, 'RouterHandler', { ... });
    return IntegrationBuilder.rest({
      ...
      defaultIntegrationOptions: {},
      buildDefaultIntegration: (op) => {
        return {
          // Reference the same router lambda handler in every integration
          integration: new LambdaIntegration(router),
        };
      },
    });
  };
}
```

You can modify the code in other ways if you prefer, for example you may prefer to define the `router` function as a parameter to `defaultIntegrations` instead of constructing it within the method.
