title: MCP Observability
---
Your MCP server is automatically configured with observability using the [AWS Distro for Open Telemetry](https://aws.amazon.com/otel/) (ADOT), by configuring auto-instrumentation in your `Dockerfile`.

You can find traces in the CloudWatch AWS Console, by selecting "GenAI Observability" in the menu. Note that for traces to be populated you will need to enable [Transaction Search](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Transaction-Search.html).

For more details, refer to the [AgentCore documentation on observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability-configure.html).
