title: MCP Server Configuration
---

### Configuration Files

Most AI assistants that support MCP use a similar configuration approach. You'll need to create or update a configuration file with your MCP server details:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "/path/to/your-mcp-server/stdio.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

:::caution
If you receive an error such as `ENOENT npx` when connecting to your server, you might need to specify the full path to `npx`, which you can obtain by running `which npx` in your terminal.
:::

### Hot Reload

While developing your MCP server, you may wish to configure the `--watch` flag so that the AI assistant always sees the latest versions of tools/resources:

```json {5}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "--watch", "/path/to/your-mcp-server/stdio.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
If you add new tools or resources you may need to refresh your MCP server in the AI assistant.

### Assistant-Specific Configuration

Please refer to the following documentation for configuring MCP with specific AI Assistants:

import Snippet from '@components/snippet.astro';

:::tip
Some AI Assistants, such as Amazon Q Developer, allow you to specify workspace level MCP server configuration, which is particularly useful for defining the relevant MCP servers for a particular project.
