title: MCP Server Configuration
---

### Configuration Files

Most AI assistants that support MCP use a similar configuration approach. You'll need to create or update a configuration file with your MCP server details:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "python",
        "-m",
        "my_module.mcp_server.stdio"
      ],
      "env": {
        "VIRTUAL_ENV": "/path/to/your/project/.venv"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::caution
If you receive an error such as `ENOENT uv` when connecting to your server, you might need to specify the full path to `uv`, which you can obtain by running `which uv` in your terminal.

### Assistant-Specific Configuration

Please refer to the following documentation for configuring MCP with specific AI Assistants:

import Snippet from '@components/snippet.astro';

:::tip
Some AI Assistants, such as Amazon Q Developer, allow you to specify workspace level MCP server configuration, which is particularly useful for defining the relevant MCP servers for a particular project.
