title: TypeScript Bundling
---
import NxCommands from '@components/nx-commands.astro';

The generator automatically configures a `bundle` target which uses [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs/) to create a deployment package:

<NxCommands commands={['run <project-name>:bundle']} />

Rolldown configuration can be found in `rolldown.config.ts`, with an entry per bundle to generate. Rolldown manages creating multiple bundles in parallel if defined.

:::tip
You can adjust the configuration for Rolldown in `rolldown.config.ts`, for example if you have dependencies which rely on file paths and cannot be bundled, you can add them to the list of `external` modules.
