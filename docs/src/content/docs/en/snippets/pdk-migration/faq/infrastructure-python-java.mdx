PDK supported CDK infrastructure written in Python and Java. We do not support this in the Nx Plugin for AWS at the time of writing.

The recommended path forward would be to either migrate your CDK infrastructure to TypeScript, or to use our generators and migrate the common constructs package to your desired language. You can use Generative AI to accelerate these kinds of migrations, for example [Amazon Q CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/learning/q-developer-cli/). You can have an AI agent iterate on the migration until the synthesized CloudFormation templates are identical.

The same applies for Type Safe API's generated infrastructure in Python or Java - you can translate the generic `rest-api.ts` construct from the common constructs package, and implement your own simple metadata generator for your target language (refer to the [APIs Modelled with OpenAPI](#apis-modelled-with-openapi) section).

You can use the <Link path="/guides/python-project">`py#project` generator</Link> for an base Python project to your CDK code to (and move over your `cdk.json` file, adding relevant targets). You can use Nx's [`@nx/gradle`](https://nx.dev/technologies/java/introduction) plugin for Java projects, or [`@jnxplus/nx-maven`](https://github.com/gridatek/jnxplus/tree/main/packages/nx-maven) for Maven.
