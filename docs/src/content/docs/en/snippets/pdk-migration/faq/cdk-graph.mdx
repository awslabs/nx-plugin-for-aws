[CDK Graph](https://aws.github.io/aws-pdk/developer_guides/cdk-graph/index.html) builds graphs of your connected CDK resources, and provided two plugins:

#### Diagram Plugin

The [CDK Graph Diagram Plugin](https://aws.github.io/aws-pdk/developer_guides/cdk-graph-plugin-diagram/index.html) generates AWS architecture diagrams from your CDK infrastructure.

For a similar deterministic approach a viable alternative is [CDK-Dia](https://github.com/pistazie/cdk-dia).

With the advancements in Generative AI, many foundation models are capabile of creating high-quality diagrams from your CDK infrastructure. We recommend trying out the [AWS Diagram MCP Server](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/aws-diagram-mcp-server). Check out [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-aws-architecture-diagrams-using-amazon-q-cli-and-mcp/) for a walkthrough.

#### Threat Composer Plugin

The [CDK Graph Threat Composer Plugin](https://aws.github.io/aws-pdk/developer_guides/cdk-graph-plugin-threat-composer/index.html) generates a starter [Threat Composer](https://github.com/awslabs/threat-composer/) threat model from your CDK code.

This plugin worked by simply filtering a [base threat model](https://github.com/aws/aws-pdk/tree/mainline/packages/cdk-graph-plugin-threat-composer/src/model-generator/base-model) containing example threats, and filtering them based on the resources your stack made use of.

If you're interested in these specific example threats you can copy and filter the base threat model, or use it as context to help a foundation model generate a similar one.
