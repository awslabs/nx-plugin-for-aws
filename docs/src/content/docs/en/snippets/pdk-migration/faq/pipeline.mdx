PDK provided a [`PDKPipelineProject`](https://aws.github.io/aws-pdk/developer_guides/pipeline/index.html) which set up a CDK infrastructure project and made use of a CDK construct which wrapped some [CDK Pipelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.pipelines-readme.html) resources.

To migrate from this, you can use the CDK Pipelines constructs directly. In practice however it is likely more straightforward to use something like GitHub actions or GitLab CI/CD, where you define [CDK Stages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/stages.html) and run the deploy command for the appropiate stage directly.
