PDK was built on top of [Projen](https://projen.io/). Projen and Nx Generators have fairly fundamental differences meaning that while it is technically possible to combine them it is likely an anti-pattern. Projen manages project files as code such that they cannot be modified directly, whereas Nx generators vend project files once and then code can be freely modified.

If you would like to continue to use Projen, you can implement your desired Projen project types yourself. To follow patterns from the Nx Plugin for AWS, you can run our generators or examine their source code on GitHub to see how your desired project types are constructed, and implement the relevant parts using Projen's primitives.
