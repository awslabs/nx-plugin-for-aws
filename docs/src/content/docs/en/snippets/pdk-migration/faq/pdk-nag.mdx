[PDK Nag](https://aws.github.io/aws-pdk/developer_guides/pdk-nag/index.html) wraps [CDK Nag](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-nag), and provides a set of [rules specific to building prototypes](https://github.com/aws/aws-pdk/blob/mainline/packages/pdk-nag/src/packs/aws-prototyping-rules.ts).

To migrate from PDK Nag, use CDK Nag directly. If you need the same set of rules you can create a "pack" of your own by following the [documentation here](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-nag/blob/main/docs/NagPack.md).
