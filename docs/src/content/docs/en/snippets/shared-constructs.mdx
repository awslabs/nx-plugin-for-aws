Since this generator vends infrastructure as code based on your chosen `iacProvider`, it will create a project in `packages/common` which includes the relevant CDK constructs or Terraform modules.

The common infrastructure as code project is structured as follows:

<Infrastructure>
<Fragment slot="cdk">
<FileTree>
  - packages/common/constructs
    - src
      - app/ Constructs for infrastructure specific to a project/generator
      - core/ Generic constructs which are reused by constructs in `app`
      - index.ts Entry point exporting constructs from `app`
    - project.json Project build targets and configuration
</FileTree>

:::note
This project is generated using the <Link path="/guides/typescript-project">`ts#project`</Link> generator and therefore configures the same build targets.
:::
</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="terraform">
<FileTree>
  - packages/common/terraform
    - src
      - app/ Terraform modules for infrastructure specific to a project/generator
      - core/ Generic modules which are reused by modules in `app`
    - project.json Project build targets and configuration
</FileTree>

:::note
This project is generated using the <Link path="/guides/terraform-project">`terraform#project`</Link> generator and therefore configures the same build targets.
