title: Usage Metrics
description: How @aws/nx-plugin collects metrics
---

In order to help us improve the Nx Plugin for AWS, we collect metrics on generator usage. This process involves no additional network requests, we simply leverage existing AWS usage metrics.

To remain transparent, we append an ID, version, and list of generator IDs to CloudFormation Stack descriptions. This is done in the `MetricsAspect` in `common/constructs`.
