## Intro

[@aws/nx-plugin](https://github.com/awslabs/nx-plugin-for-aws) is a collection of generators to help you build cloud-native applications with AWS.

## Key Features

- **Declarative**: Generate code that follows best practices for AWS cloud development.
- **Component-Based**: Add components to your project as needed, from React websites to serverless APIs using either the CLI or UI.
- **Learn Once, Use Anywhere**: Consistent patterns across different AWS services and application types.
- **Open for modification**: All code generated is your code and can be edited as you see fit.
- **Type safety**: Type-safety is employed to support IDE completions and reduce the number of runtime errors encountered.
- **Minimal dependencies**: Getting up and running is simple and only requires langugage level global dependencies.

## Available Generators

- `ts#project` - Generate a new TypeScript library.
- `ts#infra` - Generate a Typescript AWS CDK infrastructure project for your application.
- `ts#cloudscape-website` - Generate a new Cloudscape/React/Vite based web application.
- `ts#cloudscape-website#auth` - Add AWS Cognito authentication to your Cloudscape website.
- `ts#trpc-api` - Generate a tRPC backend service with Amazon API Gateway/AWS Lambda integration and [AWS Powertools](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-typescript) pre-configured.
- `py#project` - Generate a uv based Python project.
- `py#fast-api` - Generate a FastAPI backend service with [AWS Powertools](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-python) pre-configured.
- `py#lambda-function` - Add a lambda function to an existing python project with optional type-safe event sources.
- `api-connection` - Connect frontend applications to backend APIs.
- `license` - Automatically manage LICENSE files and source code headers in your workspace.

## Getting started

@aws/nx-plugin has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much of it as you need**.

1. Create a new NX workspace

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace@~20.6.3 demo --pm=pnpm --preset=ts --ci=skip --formatter=prettier
cd demo
```

2. Install the `@aws/nx-plugin`

```bash
pnpm add -Dw @aws/nx-plugin
```

3. Add components:

```bash
# Generate a tRPC API backend
pnpm nx g @aws/nx-plugin:ts#trpc-api

# Generate a Cloudscape website
pnpm nx g @aws/nx-plugin:ts#cloudscape-website

# Connect the frontend to the backend
pnpm nx g @aws/nx-plugin:api-connection

# Add authentication to your website
pnpm nx g @aws/nx-plugin:ts#cloudscape-website#auth

# Generate AWS CDK infrastructure
pnpm nx g @aws/nx-plugin:ts#infra
```
